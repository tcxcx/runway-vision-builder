# VisionRunway: Hackathon Video Script

## 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:25)

**(Scene opens with a fast-paced montage: a designer sketching, fabric swatches, the high costs on an invoice, a stressed-out person on the phone. The vibe is creative but chaotic.)**

**Narrator (Energetic, relatable tone):**
I have two friends who run their own designer clothing lines. They're incredibly talented, but they're always struggling with the single biggest hurdle for any independent brand: the photoshoot.

**(Visual: Quick cuts of a professional photoshoot - lights, cameras, models. A final cost of "$3,000" flashes on screen.)**

**Narrator:**
Models, photographers, studios, editing... it’s a logistical nightmare, and it costs a fortune. It's the one thing holding them back from showing off their new collections.

**(Visual: A sleek, dark-mode UI of VisionRunway appears. A final, stunning AI-generated runway video plays silently in the background.)**

**Narrator:**
So I asked them a simple question: "What if you could do all of that... for a fraction of the cost... in just a few minutes?"

## 2. Introducing VisionRunway (0:25 - 1:00)

**(Visual: The VisionRunway logo appears, then transitions to the main app interface, showing the empty catalogues.)**

**Narrator:**
This is VisionRunway. It's an AI-powered fashion studio that turns simple clothing images into professional photoshoots and dynamic runway videos.

**(Visual: Screen recording shows the user quickly uploading a photo of a jacket, then a model, and selecting a scene.)**

**Narrator:**
The process is simple. You start with your assets. You can upload your own clothing designs, choose a model - or even become the model yourself using your camera - and select a scene.

**(Visual: The user clicks the "Generate Photoshoot" button. A loading spinner appears.)**

**Narrator:**
Then, with one click, our AI pipeline gets to work.

## 3. The Technical Magic: Advanced API Features (1:00 - 1:50)

**(Visual: A diagram or animation appears, showing multiple images (model, jacket, pants) flying into a central "Gemini 2.5 Flash Image" node.)**

**Narrator:**
This isn't just a simple image generator. We're using the advanced multi-modal capabilities of the Gemini API to create something entirely new. First, we perform **AI Photoshoot Composition**.

**(Visual: The diagram outputs three distinct images: Front, Three-Quarter, and Side views.)**

**Narrator:**
We feed the model image, the clothing items, and the scene into **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview**. It intelligently **fuses** these separate elements into three cohesive, photorealistic shots from different angles. It understands how the fabric should drape and how the lighting should interact. This is AI-powered art direction.

**(Visual: A new diagram appears. An arrow points from the original model image to a "Gemini 2.5 Flash" node, which outputs a text prompt. This prompt and the composed photoshoot image then fly into a "Veo" node.)**

**Narrator:**
But the real challenge is **consistency**. How do you make sure the model in the video is the *exact same person* as in the photo? We solved this with a two-step **"Identity Lock"**.

**Narrator:**
First, we use Gemini to analyze the *original* model's photo and generate a hyper-specific text prompt describing her unique features—hair color, face, ethnicity. Then, we feed that identity-locked prompt, along with our composed image, into the video model. We're not just telling it *what* to wear, we're telling it *who* to be.

## 4. The Final Result (1:50 - 2:20)

**(Visual: The app UI returns, showing the finished gallery for a model. The three generated images are in the thumbnails. The main window shows the front-view shot.)**

**Narrator:**
And here are the results. Three perfect, professional product shots.

**(Visual: The user clicks the "Generate HQ Video" button. The video loads and then starts playing. The user clicks the fullscreen button.)**

**Narrator:**
And with our Identity Lock ensuring perfect consistency, we generate the final runway video. The exact same model, wearing the exact same outfit, brought to life.

**(Visual: The runway video plays in fullscreen, showcasing the fluid motion and the high quality of the output.)**

## 5. Impact and Future (2:20 - 2:50)

**(Visual: Split screen. On one side, the expensive photoshoot. On the other, the slick VisionRunway UI.)**

**Narrator:**
So, I went back to my friend, Sofia. The one who said she'd pay $300 for a tool like this? A real photoshoot for this one outfit would have cost her over ten times that.

**(Visual: The VisionRunway UI is the sole focus again.)**

**Narrator:**
VisionRunway solves a real, expensive problem for countless designers and brands. It democratizes fashion visualization.

**Narrator:**
And this is just the beginning. The video you're seeing is from Veo 2. We designed our pipeline to be ready for the future. When Veo 3 becomes available, it will unlock 4K realism, true-to-life physics, and even greater prompt adherence, taking this from a great tool to an industry-changing platform.

**(Visual: Final shot of the VisionRunway logo with the tagline.)**

**Narrator:**
VisionRunway. Your AI-powered fashion studio. The future of the photoshoot is here.
